# Noshow-Data-Analysis
This project is the first project of the nanodegree program of Udacity data analysis course. It is about analysis of a dataset of no-show appointments of patients in Brazil (dataset from kaggle). The project includes all the basic necessary steps for analyzing the data (wrangling- cleaning- exploring and visualization). Python was used to analyze the data with pandas, matplotlib and numpy libraries.
